# Chat Room

A Flutter app for chatting with others over a **local area network**â€”no internet required!

### âœ¨ Features

- **Host your own chatroom**
- **Browse and join available chatrooms** via a simple lobby interface
- **Fast and stable connections**
- **Firewall-friendly networking** for smoother device discovery
- **No location permission required on Android** for network discovery  
    Most LAN-based apps request location access due to how Android handles Wi-Fi scanning. This app avoids that by using a more efficient and reliable methodâ€”no data is collected or sent externally.

### ðŸ§ª Project Scope

This was built as a test project. While the current implementation works well on typical LAN setups, future versions may include:

- **Extended scanning options** for networks with dispersed IP ranges

### ðŸ”’ Privacy Note

_This app uses only essential network permissions to enable local chat functionality. It does **not** collect, store, or transmit your data to external servers. Your conversations stay within your network and are **completely lost** when you exit the app._
