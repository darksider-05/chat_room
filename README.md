# chat room

a flutter app to chat with others through local area network!

you have:

- chat hosting
- lobby to choose between available chatrooms
- fast and stable connection 

## now with the new update:

- connections should be super friendly when it comes to firewalls 
- on android systems, it won't require location premission to do a network discovery (basically the client sends a request to every address on the subnet(/24) to find out if there is anyone there) 
- the main idea is to have options in the app to scan a wider range if it doesn't find the device(some lans might have non concentrated addresses), but this project was a test, so, i'm not planning to go that
